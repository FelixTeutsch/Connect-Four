# Connect-Four
This is my CSC Connect Four Game

# Why have you chosen this pathway?
I chose this pathway because I wanted to explore how to implement a win condition for connect 4. Despite being a somewhat experienced coder, I found it to be a fun and engaging way to challenge my skills and build something new.

# What have been the difficulties during development? 
The most challenging aspect of this project was implementing the check for the win condition. I had an interesing concept on how to do it, but it took some time to translate that into actual code. However, through trial and error, I was ultimately able to get it working correctly.
Overall, this project was a great way to flex my programming muscles and create something from scratch.
